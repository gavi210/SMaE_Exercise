#Â Software Evolution and Maintenace
This repo contains the solution to the Classroom Exercise **Code Review**

# Exercise Description
As mentioned by the [project description](/CodeReviewExercise.pdf), ***"a group of students should select a Java project [...] and perform systematic examination of the source code . The examination is intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked in the initial development phase"*** 

# Systematic Examination
For the sake of the exercise, a github [repo](https://github.com/rajyash1904/ATM-Machine.giteviewers) has been cloned and taken as source code to be examined.
Project participants will act as ***verifiers/reviewers** and provide feedback and comments to improve overall code quality.

# Dimensions of Code Quality
During code review, a well established set of features is used to assess code quality. The list of features used could be found [here](https://www.liberty.edu/media/1414/%5B6401%5Dcode_review_checklist.pdf).
